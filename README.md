# London-Bike-Rides

This is a quick project using Python to cleanse the Kaggle London Bike Rentals dataset. 

I utilized the Kaggle package to download the zipfile and extracted this data into a csv. This CSV was placed into a pandas dataframe then manipulated to map the weather and season columns from numeric values into categorical strings for better understanding. Afterwards this data is exported into XLSX format and loaded into Tableau where an interactive dashboard was created
